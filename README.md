# supermarket_analysis

* Overview:
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a supermarket dataset sourced from Kaggle. The analysis was conducted using Google Colab, and the key questions addressed during the exploration are outlined below. The dataset contains information about various aspects of the supermarket, including sales, payment methods, customer ratings, and more.

**Key Questions Explored**
*Data Exploration:
1.Display top 5 rows of the dataset using the head method.
2.Display last 5 rows of the dataset.
3.Print random 5 rows from the dataset.
4.Find the shape of the dataset (Number of rows & Number of columns).
5.Get information about the dataset (total number of rows, total number of columns, data types of each column, and memory requirement).
6.Get overall statistics about the dataset.


**Univariate Analysis:**
1.Find aggregate sales among the branches (categorical column).
2.Find the most popular payment method used by customers (categorical column).
3.Find the distribution of customer ratings (Numerical column).
4.Find the distribution of the cost of goods sold (numerical column).

**Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:**
1.Does the cost of goods sold affect the ratings that the customers provide? (Numerical).
2.Does Gross income affect the ratings that the customers provide? (Numerical).
3.Find the most profitable branch as per gross income (numerical-categorical).
4.Is there any relationship between gender and gross income? (Numerical-categorical).
5.Find the product line that generates the most income (numerical-categorical).
6.Highest unit price in the product line (numerical-categorical).
7.Find the difference payment methods used by customers citywise (categorical-categorical).
8.Which product line is purchased in the highest quantity?
9.Display daily sales by day of the week.
10.What will be the highest months for sales?

**Conclusion**
These analyses offer valuable insights into the supermarket's operations, customer preferences, and sales trends. The findings can inform strategic decision-making for the business and provide a basis for further, in-depth exploration. The Jupyter notebook in this repository serves as a comprehensive reference for the analysis conducted.
